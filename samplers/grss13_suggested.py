            Sensing Society aimed at investigating the synergistic use of hyperspectral and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data. The data 
            sets distributed to the participants during the Contest, a hyperspectral imagery and the corresponding LiDAR-derived digital surface 
            model (DSM), were acquired by the NSF-funded Center for Airborne Laser Mapping over the University of Houston campus and its 
            neighboring area in the summer of 2012. This paper highlights the two awarded research contributions, which investigated different 
            approaches for the fusion of hyperspectral and LiDAR data, including a combined unsupervised and supervised classification scheme, 
            and a graph-based method for the fusion of spectral, spatial, and elevation information. Â© 2014 IEEE.},

    Article Sampler Description Excerpt:

    Observations/Notes:
    - Many articles which utilize the GRSS13 data note that they use the suggested/provided training and testing CPLs provided by the contest
    committee. This sampler then provides exactly that set of the training and testing CPLs. The only other action this method performs is to
    ensure that the provided CPLs do not allow patches to overrun the edge of the image bounds because it allows for variable patch sizing.
