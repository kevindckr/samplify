            algorithms (decision trees and neural nets) applied to AVHRR data to map regional land cover in Central America. Our 
            results indicate that the sampling procedure used to stratify ground data into train and test sub-populations can 
            substantially bias accuracy assessment results. In particular, we found spatial autocorrelation in test data to inflate 
            estimates of classification accuracy by up to 50 points. Results from evaluations performed using independent train and 
            test data suggest that the feature space provided by AVHRR NDVI data is poorly suited for most land cover mapping problems, 
            with the exception of those involving highly generalized classes. Â© 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

    Article Sampler Description Excerpt:
    Section 2.2 "First, the data were stratifed into independent train and test sets using pixels selected at random from the entire 
    dataset, independent of the site from which they were derived. Second, the data were randomly stratifed into independent train and 
    test groups keeping data from individual sites together. We will refer to the former method as 'pixel-based splits' and the latter 
    as 'site-based splits'."

    Observations/Notes:
    - Friedl is the earliest identified reference to describe spatially partitioning data to ensure no overlap is present.
    - This implementation of spatial partitioning is simple (dumb) and could easily be improved with human input or other modifications.
    See SpatialPartitioning (not Simple). The only reason this method exists is to automate the process of spatial partitioning in the 
    simplest possible manner for empirical testing.
